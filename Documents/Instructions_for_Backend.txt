How to Set Up and Run Backend Server
1- Install Flask and requests. 
2- Open Blazr directory (should contain blazr.py)
3- windows cmd: 
	set FLASK_APP=blazr.py
	flask run
   (if on mac/linux)
	export FLASK_APP=blazr.py
	flask run
4- Once server is up you can make calls to it by typing into a browser (or making an http request via other software)  the following: "http://localhost:5000/" + endpoint
5- '/' route should render the index.html page in templates
